So code package have these read me things
Im really just doing this to learn coding and how to use github
This is website I probably wont finish that can find smaller words in big ones
For example the word "turd" is in "Saturday"
When I get it working if for whatever reason someone acctualy wants to cheack it out
open index.html on your browser

It is technically open source because I don't want to pay for a pro github account
so if you wanna add something, be my guest

Not expecting anyone to even read this thou so yea
